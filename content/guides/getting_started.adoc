== What tools do I need?

Clojure is a https://clojure.org/about/dynamic[dynamic development environment] where you interact with your program while you write it, growing and adding to it while it's running. To work with Clojure you need an editor that supports evaluation from source files and structural editing (working with nested forms in addition to character editing).
Install these first:

* <<install_clojure#,Clojure>> - language, REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop), library support, and runner
* Editor - choose one of:
** <<aquamacs#,Aquamacs>> [Mac]
** <<vscode-clover#,VS Code>> [Windows, Linux, Mac]

== How do I work with these tools?

The details will depend on your operating system and editor but the essential flow is:

* Start the editor
* Create or open a file
* Connect a REPL
* Type Clojure code
* Evaluate the code in the connected REPL
* Repeat!

Follow one of these tutorials:

* Aquamacs [Mac]
* VS Code

Learn more:

* Structural editing - working with code as forms, not text
* Other editors - many editors can be used and provide additional functionality

== How do I learn the language?

There are many ways to learn the Clojure language. This tutorial covers the basics:

<<learn/syntax#,Learn Clojure guide>>

If you'd like to work from a <<xref/../../community/books#,book>>, these are some excellent starting points:

If you'd like to try some practice problems:

* https://exercism.io/tracks/clojure[exercism Clojure track] - larger problems with mentor support

Or check out <<xref/../../community/resources#_tutorials_and_learning_materials,other learning resources>> for more options...

== Where can I ask questions?

There are many places to interact with other Clojure developers:

* https://ask.clojure.org[Ask Clojure] [official] - Clojure Q&A and knowledgebase
* https://clojurians.net[Clojurians Slack channel] - Clojure live chat, check out #beginners, #jobs, etc
* https://clojureverse.org[Clojureverse] - Clojure forum
* https://groups.google.com/group/clojure[Clojure mailing list] (official)

== Other resources


The `linux-install` script can be removed after installation.

=== Installation on Windows

An early release version of clj on Windows is available at https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows[clj on Windows].
Please provide feedback on https://ask.clojure.org[Ask Clojure] or Clojurians slack in #clj-on-windows.

=== Other versions

See the <<xref/../../releases/tools#,changelog>> for version history and the https://github.com/clojure/homebrew-tools[Clojure tap] for info on installing older versions or newer prereleases instead.

* <<deps_and_cli#,Clojure CLI guide>>
* <<repl/introduction#,REPL guide>>
* <<xref/../../community/tools#,More Clojure editors>> - many Clojure editor options exist that add additional features
