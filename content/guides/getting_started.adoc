== What tools do I need?

Clojure is a https://clojure.org/about/dynamic[dynamic development environment] where you interact with your program while you write it, growing and adding to it while it's running. To work with Clojure you need an editor that supports evaluation from source files and structural editing (working with nested forms in addition to character editing).
Install these first:

* <<install_clojure#,Clojure>> - language, REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop), library support, and runner
* <<editors#,Editor>> - editor with interactive development support

== How do I work with these tools?

The details will depend on your operating system and editor but the essential flow for all of them is the same:

* Create or open a file
* Connect a Clojure environment (often called a REPL, the Read Eval Print Loop)
* Write Clojure code
* Evaluate the code in the connected environment
* Repeat!

Learn more:

* <<repl/introduction,REPL>> - learn more about the REPL and how to use it interactively
* <<structural_editing,Structural editing>> - working with code as forms, not text

== How do I learn the language?

There are many ways to learn the Clojure language. This tutorial covers the basics:

<<learn/clojure#,Learn Clojure guide>>

If you'd like to work from a <<xref/../../community/books#,book>>, these are some excellent starting points:

If you'd like to try some practice problems:

* https://4clojure.oxal.org/[4Clojure] - a large set of Clojure practice problems
* https://exercism.io/tracks/clojure[exercism Clojure track] - larger problems with mentor support

== Where can I ask questions?

There are many places to interact with other Clojure developers:

* https://ask.clojure.org[Ask Clojure] [official] - Clojure Q&A and knowledgebase
* https://clojurians.net[Clojurians Slack channel] - Clojure live chat, check out #beginners, #jobs, etc
* https://clojureverse.org[Clojureverse] - Clojure forum
* https://groups.google.com/group/clojure[Clojure mailing list] (official) - no longer very active
